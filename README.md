# ec-weather - an Environment Canada weather forecast feed in JSON

[Weather.gc.ca](http://weather.gc.ca) provides weather forecasts for 768 locations
in Canada, on the website and as atom RSS feeds. The purpose of this library is to
transform this raw feed into clean, well formatted JSON suitable for use in your
Node or Browser application.

# Installation
```bash
npm install ec-weather
```

# API
The module is called with a single options object.
```javascript
const ecweather = require('ec-weather');

var options = {
  lang: 'en',
  city: 'nb-23',
};

ecweather(options)
```
The two parameters are:
- **lang** {string} - either '*en*' or '*fr*'.  Default '*en*'.
- **city** {string} - 5 character Environment Canada city code.

Returns a promise, which resolves to the forecast as a JSON object.

## City Codes
Environment Canada uses 4-5 character city codes to identify
the location for a given forecasts.  The city code can be found by navigating to the Local
forecast, and examining the URL.

For example:
```
https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/on-82_metric_e.html --> on-82
https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/ns-19_metric_e.html --> ns-19
```

# Use
Sample code is available in the **examples** directory.

## Browser
Note the `axios` dependency. It must be in scope before loading `ec-weather`.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
<script src="ec-weather.js"></script>
<pre id="json"></pre>
<script>
ecWeather({
        lang: 'en',
        city: 'nb-23',
    })
    .then((data) => {
        document.getElementById('json').innerHTML = JSON.stringify(data, undefined, 2);
    });
</script>
```
### A note about [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)
When testing in a browser, you may get the following error:
```
Failed to load https://weather.gc.ca/rss/city/nb-23_e.xml: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
```
This occurs if the server hosting the javascript code above does not present the *Access-Control-Allow-Origin* header, or the
value does not match your local host. During development, you can workaround the issue with the
[Cross Domain - CORS extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cross-domain-cors/mjhpgnbimicffchbodmgfnemoghjakai?hl=en)
in the Chrome Web Store.

## Node
```javascript
const ecweather = require('ec-weather');

let data = await ecweather({
  lang: 'en',
  city: 'nb-23',
})

console.log(JSON.stringify(data, undefined, 2));
```
